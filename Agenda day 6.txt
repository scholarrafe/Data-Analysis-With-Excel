Agenda:

	- vLookup with match function
	- limitation of vlookup
	- Index and match
	- data validation and list with lookup

1. Lookup with match function: 
	why - in vlookup input we have to give the column number of the data we want to fetch, but if there is so many
		columns in the data and it's hard to findout the column number then Match Function comes into to picture.
	we have to use : vlookup(lookup_value, lookup_array, match(lookup_column_name, column_headings))
	 
2. Limitation of vlookup: 

	1. you are searching for the column value always should be in the right side of lookup array. 
	2. for Approximate match, data must be sorted in ascending order.

   here xLookup() comes into the picture. it allow this. for this you just have select the lookup column and target column
	XLookup can give output of multiple column.
3. data validation: you can create dropdown manu for data any cell. going to Data ribbon

4. we can get exact same output like xlookup if we use index+match, =Index(output_colum,Match(lookup_value,lookup_column,0))

	- for double lookup we can use =index(table,match(o),match(col))


5. Text : 
 	- can use textjoin() or concat() to join two text column(full_name from first_name and last_name)
